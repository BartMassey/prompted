# Prompted: Rust crate for prompting and input
Copyright (c) 2017 Bart Massey

This crate is a prototype of stuff I hope to get into the
Rust standard libraries. It provides macros for printing and
flushing a non-nl-terminated line, and a macro for prompting
for a line of input.

It's all very preliminary. See the [rustdoc](target/doc/prompted/index.html) for details.
